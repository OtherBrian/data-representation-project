          <h1>Welcome to Coffee Beans by the Bean!</h1>

        <p>
            Here you'll find an example of a simple online store built using Flask, a Python library.<br><br>
            As you are not currently logged in, you can just see this page, browse the Product's page, or go log in.<br> 
            If you attempt to navigate to any of the pages that require authorization, you will hit an error page. Go ahead, try the <a href="/viewcustomers">Customers</a> page now, then hit back in your browser to return to this page. <br><br>
            On the Products page, you'll find each of the products available in the store, as well as an option to filter them by price.<br> 
            This information is served via AJAX GET requests to a MySQL database, and presented in a lovely table.<br><br>
            Once you've had a chance to browse the catalogue in the Products section, you can head to the Login page. <br>
            Once logged in, you'll be able to see even more functionality of this webstore app. I'll provide more details once you're in!
